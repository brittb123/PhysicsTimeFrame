## What is this application:
This application uses bootstrap to make a custom physics engine that simulates real physics such Newton’s three laws!
It’s a basic simulation of spheres colliding with each other to send the last and first one to bounce off the wall 
and to start the process all over again! 

 ## How to run: 
Start in the base folder and then open the folder Physics in Bootstrap afterwards there is a second folder named 
Physics Simulation Executable! Once inside the folder there will be an exe named PhysicsProject.exe, right click
and press run or double click it to start the application! The exe will open a separate window with the simulation started!

## How to use:
Once the application is opened the simulation will start to play which is a sphere colliding with each other 
showing that one stops, and the momentum continues to the next! If you wish to exit the simulation just press
the escape key or if you wish to restart the simulation the key to do so is to press the R key!

## Improvements to be made: 

There are many ways to improve the current simulation from more physics algorithms to even more collisions such as adding 
boxes to the scene! A improvement that will be worked on is to make it a billiards game using player input to sink all pool
balls into the pockets using the physics shown! Obstacles can be used such as adding boxes to add extra trajectory to the simulation 
to show angles being used!

## External Sources Used:
The main source used is the bootstrap repository to download and able to work in bootstrap to make this custom
 engine possible! The link to the repository from where to get bootstrap is this GitHub link:
